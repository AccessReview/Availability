# Access Review Case Study
You work as a busy head of the marketing department in a large industry company with many concurrent projects to maximize your company's income. Your time is limited, and you have marketing goals to fulfill. 

The security teams reminded you via email that your company is legally required (compliance) to review the permission assignments for the employees in your department. You must follow the **principle of least privilege**: Employees must have permissions required for their job, but not more. If you decide to revoke an excessive permission for one of your employees, the employee will no longer be able to access the associated resources by tomorrow. 

While the security team points out that any excessive permission poses a security threat, you are aware that missing ones might prevent your employees from working until they re-obtain it via a time-consuming help-desk or self-service request. 
The marketing department consists of three teams: 

## 1. Graphic design team 
- Create and edit images for the company's media and advertisement presence. This includes banners, logos, websites, or campaign designs used in advertisements or social media posts.
- Require a Photoshop license to work. 

## 2. Social media team 
- Manage the company's social media accounts.
- Need to communicate with potential customers, candidates for recruiting, and partners online. 

## 3. Event management team 
- Organize trade fairs and partner events across West and Central Europe.
- Book trade fair stands.
- High self-organization; often needs to attend remote events without long preparation. 

## 4. Department hierarchies 
- Every team is led by a team lead who overlooks the employee's attendance and work results. 
- Team leads have an annual budget for bonus payments, which they can distribute among their team members based on last year's performance. The secretary reads the specified bonus payments defined by the team leads from the HR system and arranges for the salary to be posted. 
- The department's trainee used to intern in the graphic design team. Now, he is working in the social media team. 

## 5. Misc
- Everybody communicates with MS Teams and Outlook. 
- You can sort the columns of the access review.
